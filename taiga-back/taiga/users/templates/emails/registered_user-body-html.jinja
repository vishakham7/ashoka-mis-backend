            <p>We built Taiga because we wanted the project management tool that sits open on our computers all day long, to serve as a continued reminder of why we love to collaborate, code and design.</p>
            <p>We built it to be beautiful, elegant, simple to use and fun - without forsaking flexibility and power.</p>
